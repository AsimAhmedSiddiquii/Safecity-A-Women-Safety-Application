# Safecity: A Women Safety Application

</br>
## About the Project:
- The aim of this study was to provide women a platform that is capable of providing help to them, when in danger. 
  Today, in national as well as international society there are serious issues related to women safety and harassment. 
- The only ghosting question in women/girls mind is when are they going to move freely on the streets even in the odd hours of the day/night without worrying 
  about their security. Although there are previous methods/ technologies, android based applications such as VithU, Nirbhaya or SOS based mobile technologies. 
  But these methods prove to be ineffective on providing concrete solution rather than only addressing the problem. 
- The proposed application is capable of providing SOS Service to the user by identifying unsafe zones nearby. A women ecosystem is created.
